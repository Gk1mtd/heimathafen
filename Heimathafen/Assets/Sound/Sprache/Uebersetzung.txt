I hope this letter reaches you as soon as you reach safe grounds again.Little Lisbeth is already so eager to lay her arms around her beloved Father again. Just like me. We miss you incredibly, but the more pleased we are to hear, that you are on your way home already. Its been far too long, since you last spent time with us. Here at home. Waiting for you in love,Little Lisbeth and your Wife Anna."So, what do you think about this? How could something tragic like this happen?""Well, it was absolutely unstoppable. The Southern Lands had already been destroyed by several Waves, by the time we had received the first letters.  But we are indeed doing our best to limit this tragedy in its extent.""But what are we up against?" "Something horrible. It doesnt stop at anything, not even the dead.""How can we stop it?""I fear, we might not be able to."
